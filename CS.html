    <h1>Summer Programs</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <a href="https://www.awesomemath.org">AwesomeMath</a>. A virtual, three
        week camp focused on math competitions. Talk to Gary Gao if you want to
        know more about this summer program - he's an alum!
      </li>

      <li>
        <a href="https://www.mathcamp.org">Canada/USA Mathcamp</a>. A five week
        long camp at a different location every year, that presents a ton of
        crash courses on math topics that most people don't encounter until
        their undergrad/grad years. Talk to Gary Hu if you want to know more
        about this summer program, and/or read his
        <a href="https://garyhu.vercel.app/tags/mcsp">blog posts</a> (that will
        hopefully be posted by the time someone reads this) about his experience
        at mathcamp'22.
      </li>

      <li>
        <a href="http://www.mathily.org">MathILy</a> at Bryn Mawr College.
      </li>

      <li>
        <a href="https://promys.org">PROMYS</a>. A rigorous six week long number
        theory camp at Boston University. It's also worth checking out
        <a href="https://promys-europe.org">PROMYS Europe</a>, which is much
        cheaper.
      </li>

      <li>
        <a href="https://rossprogram.org">Ross</a>. A rigorous six week long
        number theory camp held at two locations every summer: Ohio Dominican
        University and Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology. Very similar to
        PROMYS, but has a higher acceptance rate.
      </li>

      <li>
        <a href="https://sumac.spcs.stanford.edu">SUMaC</a>. A virtual, three
        week camp run by Stanford where you learn about college level math. In
        2022, there were two programs, one on Abstract Algebra & Number Theory,
        and the other on Algebraic Geometry.
