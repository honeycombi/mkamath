    <h1>Opportunities</h1>

    <h2>Contests</h2>

    These contests are held at MKA every year.

    <ol>
      <li>
        NJML: 6 contests (one a month) with each contest consisting of 6
        problems to be solved in 30 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        AMC 10/12: MKA hosts two AMC contests in November, each consisting of 25
        problems to solve in 75 minutes. If you do well enough, you can qualify
        for more competitions.
      </li>
      <li>
        Purple Comet: A 30 problems, 90 minutes team solving competition in
        April.
      </li>
    </ol>

    Note that there are many competitions not hosted by MKA that might be of
    interest, including USAMTS, HMMT, CMIMC, etc.

    <h2>Summer Programs</h2>

    There is a very good list on the
    <a href="https://mitadmissions.org/apply/prepare/summer/">MIT Admissions</a>
    website. Here are two programs that MKA club leaders have attended:

    <ul>
      <li>
        <a href="https://www.awesomemath.org">AwesomeMath</a>. A virtual, three
        week camp focused on math competitions. Talk to Gary Gao if you want to
        know more about this summer program - he's an alum!
      </li>

      <li>
        <a href="https://www.mathcamp.org">Canada/USA Mathcamp</a>. A five week
        long camp at a different location every year, that presents a ton of
        crash courses on math topics that most people don't encounter until
        their undergrad/grad years. Talk to Gary Hu if you want to know more
        about this summer program - he's an alum.
      </li>
    </ul>

    If you are interested in doing math research, consider applying to
    <a href="https://math.mit.edu/research/highschool/primes/index.php"
      >PRIMES-USA</a
    >
    or
    <a href="https://www.cee.org/programs/research-science-institute"
      >Research Science Institute (RSI)</a
    >, but do note that both of these programs are extremely selective
    (PRIMES-USA accepts less than 40 people in the nation and RSI has a 3%
    acceptance rate).

    <h2>Community Service</h2>

    Gary Hu is a cofounder of a 501(c)3 approved nonprofit (which means that you
    can get community service hours for the PVSA community service award) that
    has written math articles and held math bootcamps in the past on various
    topics. If you are interested in helping out, talk to him in person or email
    him.
